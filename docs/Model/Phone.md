# Phone

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**country_code** | **string** | The seller&#x27;s country calling code. This field is needed if the buyer is located in a different country than the seller. It is also OK to provide if the buyer and seller are both located in the same country. For a full list of calling codes for all countries, see the &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://countrycode.org/ \&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;countrycode.org&lt;/a&gt; site. | [optional] 
**number** | **string** | The seller&#x27;s primary phone number associated with the return address. When this number is provided in a &lt;strong&gt;contestPaymentDispute&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;contestPaymentDispute&lt;/strong&gt; method, it is provided as one continuous numeric string, including the area code. So, if the phone number&#x27;s area code was &#x27;408&#x27;, a number in this field may look something like this: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;\&quot;number\&quot; : \&quot;4088084356\&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the buyer is located in a different country than the seller, the seller&#x27;s country calling code will need to be specified in the &lt;strong&gt;countryCode&lt;/strong&gt; field. | [optional]
